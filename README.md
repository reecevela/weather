While creating this, I learned a lot about asynchronous coding and how to use an icons library.

This project was also really interesting because I approached it by creating and rendering all of the HTML with JavaScript, so that it's easier to set up and tear down after API requests for different locations.

The next biggest learning experience I had with this project was the UI. Originally I overused the neon blue and didn't have a dark enough background, even at one point having an svg background with distracting wavy neon blue lines. In the end I toned it down a lot and kept more simplicity with black and whites, with a touch of color to communicate relevant weather info as well as leaving detailed info blue so you can glance over it more easily to skim the main info for each day.
